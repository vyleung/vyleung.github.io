Due to the pandemic, I transitioned the study online using Google Slides and conducted the study over Zoom for my senior thesis.\nWe placed a black dot in the middle of the shapes to indicate to children that they can move the shapes and to guide them where to click/tap.\nThis is an overview of the patterning study. Slide 1 invited children to play a patterning game. Slides 2 and 3 showed children how to move shapes around in Google Slides. Slide 4 served as practice for children to move the sun to the either cloud. Slide 5 asked children to duplicate the pattern. Slides 6, 7, 12, and 13 were abstraction tasks and asked children to create the pattern using different shapes. Slide 8 showed a row of 6 houses, where children moved each house to reveal that a star was hidden under every third house. Slide 9 ointroduced children to an extension of the row of houses in Slide 8. On Slide 10, children either engaged in pattern learning (aka the Houses task) via demonstration (watching the experimenter move the houses to reveal a star/no star) or exploration (moving the houses on their own to reveal a star/no star). Slide 14 concluded the study and thanked children for participating.\nAll slides were revealed incrementally along with verbal instructions to help draw children\u0026rsquo;s attention to each aspect of the slide (duplication task).\nAll slides were revealed incrementally along with verbal instructions to help draw children\u0026rsquo;s attention to each aspect of the slide (introduction to the Houses task).\nStudy Results Children who learned by exploring tended to find more stars and display more advanced patterning strategies than children who learned by watching a demonstration.

The courses span different areas of psychology (e.g., developmental, social, and cognitive), natural sciences, quantitative skills, statistics, and computer programming.\nI also minored in Education Studies (EDS), which consists of 7 upper-division courses. The courses span teaching and learning, learning environments, language and culture, and school and society.\nIn addition to these courses, I took general education (GE) courses as part of Eleanor Roosevelt College (ERC) requirements. The courses span a 5-quarter writing program called Making of the Modern World (MMW) that integrates the humanities and social sciences, fine arts, foreign language, and regional specialization (The Americas and Multi-Ethnic United States). The quantitative skills and natural sciences courses overlap with those in the Psychology program.\nSee the timeline below for the courses I took during each quarter. I hope this is helpful for prospective students interested in studying Psychology and/or Education Studies at UCSD. Feel free to reach out via email or LinkedIn if you have any questions ðŸ™‚\nProgram Timeline Year 1 (Freshman Year) I spent my entire freshman year completing GE courses and a few lower-division courses for my major. One course that stood out was Introduction to Art History (VIS 20), where I learned about artworks from different time periods and gained a deeper appreciation for art. For one of our assignments, we were asked to visit an art museum in San Diego and select an artwork to analyze. I visited the Timken Museum of Art and wrote about Luca di TommÃ¨\u0026rsquo;s The Trinity and the Crucifixion, with Scenes from the Life of Christ. Prior to taking the course, the only times I went to art museums were for field trips in middle and high school. Now, I have visited numerous art museums and try to visit one whenever I travel.\nFall 2017 Winter 2018 Spring 2018 Chemistry I (CHEM 6A) #PSYC #ERC Race and Ethnicity in the United States: Asian Americans (HILD 7B) #ERC Organismic and Evolutionary Biology (BILD 3) #PSYC #ERC Calculus I (MATH 10A) #PSYC #ERC Calculus II (MATH 10B) #PSYC #ERC Fluency in Information Technology (CSE 3) #PSYC Pre-history and Ancient Foundations (MMW 11) #ERC Classical and Medieval Traditions (MMW 12) #ERC New Ideas and Cultural Encounters (MMW 13) #ERC Introduction to Art History (VIS 20) #ERC General Psychology: Developmental Foundations (PSYC 7) #PSYC Introduction to Statistics (PSYC 60) #PSYC #ERC Year 2 (Sophomore Year) I started taking EDS courses and getting involved in research with the Clarke Lab during my sophomore year. For all 3 practicum courses (EDS 139), I was placed in a 6th grade classroom in a Title I elementary school in National City, CA, volunteering as a tutor and mentoring two students 4 hours/week each quarter. One highlight from the practicum courses took place toward the end of Fall 2018. As part of our final project for Introduction to Academic Mentoring of Elementary School Students (EDS 130), we were tasked with making an artifact (e.g., a book or game) for and with our mentees. Over several lunch sessions, I worked with my mentees to brainstorm ideas and create a storyboard for their books. Two Saturday\u0026rsquo;s before our final projects were due, our class hosted a workshopping event on campus and invited all our mentees to join. After the event, I gave my mentees a short tour of the campus and was able to bring them to a large lecture hall. They marveled at its size before racing down to the chalkboards and pretending they were professors. Overall, the practicum courses were incredibly rewarding and special experiences that enabled me to bond with students and watch them grow academically and personally as the school year progressed. It was after these experiences that I declared my minor in Education Studies.\nFall 2018 Winter 2019 Spring 2019 Introduction to Academic Mentoring of Elementary School Students (EDS 130) #EDS\nlink to project Introduction to Action Research in P-12 Education (EDS 140) #EDS Action Research in Pâ€“12 Education: Advanced Practicum in Pâ€“12 Schools and Communities (EDS 141) #EDS Practicum in Teaching and Learning (EDS 139) #EDS Practicum in Teaching and Learning (EDS 139) #EDS Practicum in Teaching and Learning (EDS 139) #EDS Research Methods in Psychology (PSYC 70) #PSYC\nlink to project Revolution, Industry, and Empire (MMW 14) #ERC Twentieth Century and Beyond (MMW 15) #ERC Developmental Psychology (PSYC 101) #PSYC #EDS Social Psychology (PSYC 104) #PSYC Behavioral Neuroscience (PSYC 106) #PSYC Cognitive Psychology (PSYC 105) #PSYC Psychological Disorders of Childhood (PSYC 168) #PSYC Independent Study [Research Assistant @ Clarke Lab] (PSYC 199) #PSYC Independent Study [Research Assistantship @ Clarke Lab] (PSYC 199) #PSYC Year 3 (Junior Year) I spent my junior year taking upper-division courses for my major and minor and completing my last GE. In addition to coursework, I began to work at the Early Learning and Cognition Lab as a research assistant and continued working as a research assistant in the Clarke Lab. Balancing academics and research was not an easy feat by any means, and I had to quickly learn how to effectively manage my time and energy. A course that stood out was Language, Culture, and Society (EDS 117) because of its four investigative assignments. These assignments required us to informally interview three people about a particular course topic (e.g., educational success and culture, identity, and bilingual education) and summarize and analyze their responses. During class, we were put into small groups and shared our interview responses with our peers. A few weeks before the end of the Winter 2020 quarter, the COVID-19 virus emerged and all finals were moved online. Soon after the pandemic hit full force, and the remainder of my undergraduate career took place online.\nFall 2019 Winter 2020 Spring 2020 Second-Year Chinese for Dialect Speakers I (CHIN 20AD) #ERC Language, Culture, and Society (EDS 117) #EDS Social Organization of Education (EDS 126) #EDS Clinical Assessment and Treatment (PSYC 124) #PSYC Behavior Modification (PSYC 154) #PSYC Psychology of Sleep (PSYC 191) #PSYC Criminology (PSYC 164) #PSYC Adolescence (PSYC 180) #PSYC Topics in Psychology: Educational Psychology (PSYC 193) #PSYC Industrial/Organizational Psychology (PSYC 178) #PSYC Development of Social Cognition (PSYC 187) #PSYC Instruction in Psychology [Undergraduate Instructional Assistant for Developmental Psychology (PSYC 101)] (PSYC 195) #PSYC Year 4 (Senior Year) My senior year was much more relaxed compared to my sophomore and junior years because I had completed nearly all my major and minor requirements for graduation. I spent this year working on my thesis and taking some elective courses. As someone who was interested in learning to code, I thought that this was the perfect time to learn and took two Computational Social Science (CSS) courses, where I learned Python. CSS 1 taught the fundamentals of Python (e..g, lists, dictionaries, and functions) and introduced several libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib). Building on this foundation, CSS 2 focused on machine learning and covered topics such as feature engineering, linear and polynomial regression, binary classification, and cross-validation. Through these courses, I developed skills in thinking programmatically and coding, which were useful later on when I learned JavaScript on my own.\nFall 2020 Winter 2021 Spring 2021 Cognitive Development and Education (EDS 115) #EDS Introductory Programming for Computational Social Science (CSS 1) #PSYC #ERC Data and Model Programming for Computational Social Science (CSS 2) #PSYC #ERC Psychology Laboratory Topics: Cognition Lab (PSYC 193L) #PSYC\nlink to project Personal Financial Management (MGT 12) Research Thesis III [@ Early Learning and Cognition Lab] (PSYC 196C) #PSYC Research Thesis I [@ Early Learning and Cognition Lab] (PSYC 196A) #PSYC Research Thesis II [@ Early Learning and Cognition Lab] (PSYC 196B) #PSYC Course Structure UCSD follows the quarter system, which comprises 10 weeks.
