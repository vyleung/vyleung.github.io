Children were presented with different aspects of the game (e.g. weight of the blocks) and were asked to decide how to adjust the aspects (e.g. all light, all heavy, or half light and half heavy blocks) in 2 situations (playing for fun or to win stickers).\nPatterning in Children Sep 2020 – Jun 2021\nUndergraduate Thesis at UC San Diego: \u0026ldquo;Using Exploration to Support Children\u0026rsquo;s Pattern Learning\u0026rdquo;\nAbout the study We placed a black dot in the middle of the shapes to indicate to children that they can move the shapes and to guide them where to click/tap.\nThis is an overview of the patterning study. The study was created using Google Slides and conducted with children 4-6 years old via Zoom.\nAll slides were revealed incrementally along with verbal instructions to help draw children\u0026rsquo;s attention to each aspect of the slide. In this task, children were asked to duplicate the pattern.\nIn this novel patterning task, children either engaged in pattern learning via demonstration (watching the experimenter move the houses to reveal a star/no star) or exploration (moving the houses on their own to reveal a star/no star). Stars were hidden under every third house. After completing this task, children were shown the same repeating pattern (but with lightbulbs instead of houses) and were given 5 chances to find the stars.\nResults Children who learned by exploring tended to find more stars and display more advanced patterning strategies than children who learned by watching a demonstration.\nData Visualizations using Python\nClassInSight Jan 2018 – Jun 2021\nClassInSight is a 5-year design-based research project involving Carnegie Melleon University, Penn State University, and UC San Diego that studies how secondary science teachers facilitate rich classroom discussions. I assisted with conducting on a systematic literature review, processing video, audio, and transcript data, and analyzing teachers\u0026rsquo; baseline interviews. My work helped to inform the design of the ClassInSight web application that was developed for teachers to reflect on visualizations of their discussions.\nClass Research Projects Cognition Lab Sep 2020 – Dec 2020\n\u0026ldquo;Effect of Increased Cognitive Load on Eyewitnesses\u0026rsquo; Memory Accuracy\u0026rdquo;\nAction Research in P-12 Schools Jan 2019 – Jun 2019\n\u0026ldquo;A Case Study Examining Intrinsic Motivation During Early Adolescence\u0026rdquo;\nResearch Methods in Psychology Sep 2018 – Dec 2018\n\u0026ldquo;The Battle of Effective Studying Strategies: Blocked Versus Interleaved\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"January 01, 0001","permalink":"/projects/research-projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"Formal Research Projects SharKubb Jun 2021 - Aug 2021","title":"Research Projects"},{"content":"","date":"January 01, 0001","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
